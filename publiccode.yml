      Docker image to convert QuakeML format to Hypo71 PHS format.
    documentation: 'https://github.com/INGV/qml2hypo71phs/blob/master/README.md'
    longDescription: >
      This project is developed to create a Docker image with a simple converter from QuakeML to Hypo71 PHS.

      QuakeML is a flexible, extensible and modular XML representation of seismological data which is intended to cover a broad range of fields of application in modern seismology. More info about QuakeML: https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml/

      Hypo71 is a computer program for determining hypocenter, magnitude, and first motion pattern of local earthquakes. More info about Hypo71 format: https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr72224
